    //Start adding components to our entity
    //Entity has template method AddComponent which allows you to add all kinds of components
    //AddComponent takes as typename a component name that is available with jej::SomeComponent - style syntax
    //Every different component has a different parameter list so be sure what you're giving to your component
    //In this example, TransformComponent is created as parameter of Entity's AddComponent - method and is then added 
    //to myCharacter:

    //Creating:
    myCharacter.AddComponent<jej::TransformComponent>(
<<<<<<< HEAD
        &myCharacter,					//Tell component that this is its owner
        jej::Vector2f(0.0f, -0.3f),		//Position, we start at center of the screen
=======
        //&myCharacter,					//Tell component that this is its owner
        jej::Vector2f(0.f, 0.f),		//Position, we start at center of the screen
>>>>>>> origin/JuhoAndroidBranch
        jej::Vector2f(1.f, 1.f),		//Scale in x, y - axises
        jej::Vector4f(0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f)//Rotation x, y, z, w
        );


    //Next we create ShaderComponent and add it to our entity so it can be drawn
    myCharacter.AddComponent<jej::ShaderComponent>(
<<<<<<< HEAD
        &myCharacter,					//Tell component that this is its owner
        "FragmentShader.frag",	//First we must give vertex shader name and file extension
        "VertexShader.vert"			//Second we guve fragment shader name and file extencion
=======
        //&myCharacter					//Tell component that this is its owner
        //"PixelShader.frag",			//First we must give vertex shader name and file extension
        //"VertexShader.vert"			//Second we guve fragment shader name and file extencion
>>>>>>> origin/JuhoAndroidBranch
        );



    //Then we create and add ShapeComponent to give our entity some form and color
    //NOTICE that we don't give any coordinates yet or what type of shape this component holds
    //This is because our ShapeComponent might consist of several different shapes
    //etc. we make a pyramid that has four triangles as sides and rectangle as bottom.
    //As we add ShapeComponent, we take an alias at the sametime for ease of use.

    auto& myShapeComp = myCharacter.AddComponent<jej::ShapeComponent>(
<<<<<<< HEAD
        &myCharacter,					//Tell component that this is its owner
        jej::Vector4i(0, 150, 150, 150)	//This our shape's color in RGBA, so this is fully green and somewhat opaque
=======
        //&myCharacter,					//Tell component that this is its owner
        jej::Vector4i(0, 255, 0, 150)	//This our shape's color in RGBA, so this is fully green and somewhat opaque
>>>>>>> origin/JuhoAndroidBranch
        );


	//Now we can add shape to our ShapeComponent. AddShape - method works intuitively. 
	//As we give just one jej::Vector2f, AddShape knows we making a rectangle.
	//Note that width and height are twice the given values
    myShapeComp.AddShape(
    
		jej::Vector2f(0.3, 0.3)	//Half width, half height
    
    );


   //As we now add three points, AddShape knows we are making a triangle.
    myShapeComp.AddShape(std::vector<jej::Vector2f>
    {
            jej::Vector2f(0.0f, 0.3f),		//First point, lower-left corner
            jej::Vector2f(0.15f, 0.6f),		//Second point, upper-left corner
            jej::Vector2f(-0.15f, 0.6f)        //Third point, upper-right corner
    }
    );

    //Now we have our character with transform, shader and shape component. At this point it exist
    //in our scene and has data in it with witch we can make it react to other entities and
    //vice versa. At this point, our "myCharacter" - entity could act as invisible trigger box, or 
    //trigger triangle if you will.
    //However, we want our character to be visible protagonist that moves and shows. So, in addition to all above
    //components, we must tell our rendering system that we want to draw this entity. We do it by
    //creating and adding one more component, RenderComponent. RenderComponent is a container component that takes in
    //all the above created components and uses their data in rendering system.
    //NOTICE that we have in scope all those aliases we created, so let's use them instead of
    //fetching component with entity's GetComponentPtr<> template function

    //Creating
    myCharacter.AddComponent<jej::RenderComponent>(
        //&myCharacter
        );

//Don't try setting components to other entities other than the one calling the function

	myCharacter.AddComponent<jej::CollisionComponent>(
		&myCharacter);


    //auto& mouse = jej::Mouse::GetInstance();
    //auto& keyboard = jej::Keyboard::GetInstance();

    //Finalize EngineObject
    game.Finalize();
