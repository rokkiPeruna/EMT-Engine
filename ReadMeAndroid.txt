Android-directory includes now only the absolute minimum to build the project with AndroidStudio.

MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE AN 'android' DIRECTORY IN THE ROOT OF JEJ BEFORE PULLING THIS VERSION.
DELETE IT AND PULL THIS VERSION IF YOU HAD OR YOU AREN'T SURE IF YOU HAD.

How to use:
1. Acquire AndroidStudio.
2. Select 'open existing'.
3. Select 'android' directory from the root of JEJ.
4. Wait for the gradle to build and possibly update itself.
5. Build the project.

6. Juho: fix the things I broke.
